# code-of-conduct

## Development
This code of conduct is built using [Jekyll](www.jekyllrb.com). To develop on this locally, you must:
- `gem install bundler` if you don't already have bundler installed
- `bundle install`
- `bundle exec jekyll serve` to serve files locally
- `bundle exec jekyll build` to build static assets to serve
