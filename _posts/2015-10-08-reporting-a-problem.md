These guidelines are ambitious, and we’re not always going to succeed in meeting them. When something goes wrong—whether it’s a microaggression or an instance of harassment—there are a number of things you can do to address the situation with your fellow team members or with the entire group. We know that you’ll do your best work if you’re happy and comfortable in your surroundings, so we take concerns about this stuff seriously. Depending on your comfort level and the severity of the situation, here are some things you can do to address it: 

1. **Address it directly.** If you’re comfortable bringing up the incident with the person who instigated it, pull them aside to discuss how it affected you. Be sure to approach these conversations in a forgiving spirit: an angry or tense conversation will not do either of you any good. If you’re unsure how to go about that, try discussing with another team member first—they might have some advice about how to make this conversation happen. <br/><br/>If you’re too frustrated to have a direct conversation, there are a number of alternate routes you can take.

2. **Talk to a peer or mentor.** Your colleagues are likely to have personal and professional experience on which to draw that could be of use to you. If you have someone you’re comfortable approaching, reach out and discuss the situation with them. They may be able to advise on how they would handle it, or direct you to someone who can. The flip side of this, of course, is that you should also be available when your colleagues reach out to you.

3. **Talk to a Culture Ambassador.** A Culture Ambassador is a member of the team that has volunteered to be an as-objective-as-possible resource for conflict resolution. Currently this is Bri, but contact her to add your name to the list. CAs are commited to helping openly solve conflicts on the team and are dedicated advocates for the underrepresented and those whose voices are not often heard. They are happy to talk to you in person or remotely about the problem and help figure out what steps to take. They are good at listening to concerns about small violations, but they’ll also be able to help out in situations where more drastic action needs to be taken. In all cases, Culture Ambassadors will make every effort to stay in clear communication with anyone who reports a problem, maintaining confidentiality whenever asked.
